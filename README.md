# MEC TTP 2021 Winter Assignment 1: Choose Your Own Adventure

## Purpose

To practice fundamental git and GitHub workflows in a non-coding environment.

## Background

Choose Your Own Adventure is a series of books published in 80s and 90s where the story is broken down into segments and the reader is given choices to control how they navigate through these segments. Each book had a multitude of different endings, each achievable by a different unique combination of choices. This led to a high level of re-readability and thus became wildly popular when video game consoles and personal computers were still rare.

## Task

You are going to produce a miniature version of a Choose Your Own Adventure story, using git and GitHub to construct it collaboratively with your teammates. You will write a segment of the story, including either a number of options to choose or a unique ending to the story. Use the format below for each section:

```
## [arrive at archery competition]
You arrive at the archery competition disguised as a peasant.
No one would ever recognize you; even if they could, the dirty
blanket you have wrapped around your head stinks so much that
no one would come within 10 feet of you. The crowd is bustling
but you have your eyes fixed on the king. As he steps up to make
opening remarks, your chance for revenge takes shape. Do you:

**[call him out]** Yell over the noise and call him out.
**[wait]** Hold your tongue until you can get closer.

---

## [call him out]
You shout, "I am the daughter of Aragorn! I'm here to reclaim
my kingdom!" Unfortunately, the king had been expecting you
and royal guards appear next to you before you can know it.
They lock you in shackles in the deepest corner of the dungeon.

**[end]**
```

Have one student create a new repo and start the story. Don't forget to invite the other students as collaborators. Then, use `git pull`, `git push`, `git branch`, and `git merge` to take turns to add segments to the story.

Once you have a decent chunk of story segments, begin using advanced features of git and GitHub to continue to refine the story:
- Go back to a previous segment, change it, and then open an issue since the following segments of the story need to be changed as well. Assign these issues to other members on your team; use the issue tracker to discuss and vote on how the story should be amended.
- Use feature branches. As a team, decide on a story segment that needs to be completed. Individually, create a feature branch and hash out the story as you see fit. Then, come back together, review each other's work, and select one branch to merge back into master.

## Requirements

Each student on your team must have contributed at least 3 story segments, created and resolved at least 2 issues, and created at least 1 feature branch. For this assignment, we will review commit histories and open / closed issues.

Submit a single github link before 11:59pm EST on **Jan 5, 2021** using the following form. Only one student on your team needs to submit and be sure to tag all the team members when submitting.

## Extension

If you feel comfortable having met all the requirements and want to continue, you can try the following: replace our [key] convention with clickable links. Hint: this is the same technique that others use to build clickable table of contents in GitHub README files.
